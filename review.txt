The paper presents a novel method for the synthesis of symmetric Boolean functions - with close-to-optimum results in terms of number of binary operators. The method is inspired by the state-of-the-art method from [5]. The problem is solved as a game, at each iteration a move is added based on an estimate of the reward. An extension with decomposition is also considered. 
The paper presents an interesting idea and approach. The idea of treating the problem as a game seems valid and good results were obtained. I believe it could be an interesting paper for the IWLS audience. 
On the other hand, I sometimes found the paper a bit hard to follow due to some inconsistencies in the text, typos, and missing details. 

Here more detailed comments (major and minor): 

Abstract: 
- I believe the impact and quality of results of the proposed method could be better claimed in the abstract. Also, "72 gates representation": Is this in terms of AIGs? or XAGs? How good is such result? Could any other method find similar results? 

[ ANDREA ] I added AIG representation and compared this with the state-of-the art.

Introduction: 
- I believe it would help to add a bit more motivation on why symmetric functions could be of any practical interest. 
[ ] ADD EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Background: 
- [X] Xor And Inverter Graph (AIG). Typo, this should be XAG. Reference could help here.  
- [X] Binarized Neural Networks misses italic. 
- [X] I think "disposing of" means get rid of and not that something is at your disposal. Sentence should be corrected. 
- [X] Fig. 1: letters are missing but cited in the text (a) - (f). 
- [ ] The connection between finding close-to-optimum representations for thresholds functions and testing BNNs without GPUs is not clear. 
- [X] Section II-D: should also "gamble functions" be mentioned here? 

Section III: 
- Caption of Fig 4 is not clear. I believe this could be better explained. 

Experiments: 
- A 1): Fig 5 should be better explained (caption is also not clear). n = number of input? Numbers in each rectangle = minr? Why is first column "blue/gray"? 
- A 1): "The reason is that we want to perform an experimental verification of the quality of the results". The sentence is not clear. I guess this is because you want to run "deepsyn" and be able to compare on AIGs? 
- A 1): CCG-SYM: typo. SYM-DEC: typo. I think both should be SYM-CCG. 
- A 2): Fig 6 has wrong caption. 
- A 2): discussion about theoretical combinational complexities (shown in fig 6) and references would be helpful. Is the theoretical C in terms of AND/OR operators only or does it consider all binary instead? 
- A 3) andd -> and 
- A 3): why moving from AIGs to XAGs for this class of functions? Is it because the theoretical C is not known in terms of AND/OR operators? why are levels also reported here (see Table 3)? 
- B): Table IV is not mentioned in the paper. 
- B): what is "Zoe"? 
- B): Table IV: is "r" = min r?
